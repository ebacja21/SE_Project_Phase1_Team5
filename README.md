Problem Identification : 
The hotel website project aims to address the issue of accurately calculating booking fees across various platforms such as Booking.com and Airbnb. Unlike these platforms where users are typically charged additional fees, the proposed website will not apply any fees to bookings. This eliminates the need for users to navigate through fee structures and ensures transparency in pricing. By providing a fee-free booking experience, the website seeks to streamline the reservation process and enhance customer satisfaction.

Solution Proposal :
Make the hotel website simple: no extra fees for bookings, use computers to calculate costs automatically, connect to safe ways to pay online, show customers exactly what they’re paying for, change prices based on how many people want to book, and look at data to see how things are going. 


Project Scope : 
 The hotel website project aims to develop a user-friendly booking system that eliminates additional fees for reservations. It will include features such as automated fee calculation based on factors like stay duration and room type, integration with secure payment gateways, transparent display of costs, dynamic pricing management to adjust rates according to demand, and data analytics tools for tracking booking trends. The project will also involve designing an intuitive interface, rigorous testing to ensure functionality and security, and ongoing maintenance post-deployment.

Project Aim : The website will  develop a user-friendly website for hotel reservations that provides an intuitive booking experience for guests.
