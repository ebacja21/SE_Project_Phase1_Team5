Problem Identification : 
Numerous companies rely on various booking platforms for managing reservations and handling booking fees. These platforms often require accurate fee calculations based on factors like duration of stay, additional services, and seasonal variations. However, manually calculating booking fees for each reservation is time-consuming and prone to errors. Additionally, users often demand transparency regarding the breakdown of fees. Without a systematic method for storing and updating fee information, there's a risk of incomplete datasets, making it difficult to track and analyze fee trends over time.
Solution Proposal :
To address the challenges associated with booking fees for reservations, we propose implementing an automated booking fee management system. This system would integrate with existing booking platforms and leverage real-time data to calculate accurate fees for each reservation. By automating fee calculations, we can significantly reduce manual errors and save time for users. As the best solution in order to get the best results every guest can easily make the payment via the website. 


Project Scope : 
 Users can easily find detailed information about each hotel, including room options, prices, photos, and amenities. Also Implementing  a secure booking system that enables users to make reservations, modify bookings, and cancel reservations if necessary. Users can directly make the payment for the selected features or either any special event that the hotel offers  just by pressing the button. 

Project Aim : The website will  develop a user-friendly website for hotel reservations that provides an intuitive booking experience for guests.
